The Apprentice Accounts API provides basic account information for an apprentice, that may be consumed by the various services that comprise the overall Apprentice Portal.  It is the _Inner API_ tier, following the [Apprenticeship Service's technical guidance](https://skillsfundingagency.github.io/das-technical-guidance/api_standards/1-api-patterns-as#api-patterns-within-the-as).

## How It Works
