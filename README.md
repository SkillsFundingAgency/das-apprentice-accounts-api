The Apprentice Accounts API provides basic account information for an apprentice, that may be consumed by the various services that comprise the overall Apprentice Portal.  It is the _Inner API_ tier, following the [Apprenticeship Service's technical guidance](https://skillsfundingagency.github.io/das-technical-guidance/api_standards/1-api-patterns-as#api-patterns-within-the-as).

## How It Works

This repo has the api endpoints to perform crud operaions on account entity (the actual apprentice ‚Äì its its own microservice). 

## üöÄ Installation

The repo has a database project which should be deployed locally to a database named ‚ÄòSFA.DAS.ApprenticeLoginService.Database‚Äô

### Developer Setup

runs on: https://localhost:5801/index.html

The Apprentice Accounts API is a standard ASP.Net Core Web API project using a SQL Server database.
